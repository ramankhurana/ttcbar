## physualize: a visualisation package for HEPhysicists

Running the code is simple, 
1. prepare the python file, plot_attributes.py and process_attributes.py 
2. plot_attributes.py should have the information about which regions, variables you want to plot. 
3. process_attributes.py should have the cross-section information, color, order, should be visible in stack etc, 
4. once the dictionary are prepared, just the the files, at the end, there is a snippet to write this information into a yaml file. 
5. These yaml files are needed to create and instance of the class plotlib. 
6. To save all the plots just do: 
import plotlib as plib
plib.plotlib("plot_attributes.yaml",  "process_attributes.yaml").SaveAllPlots("stack")
